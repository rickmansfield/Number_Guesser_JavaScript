Overview

Project Goals
In this project, I've writem JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game. 

There are four functions in script.js. I’ve provided some additional JavaScript code in game.js that will call dependent functions based on user interactions.

These JavaScript functions are incorporated into a website that also uses HTML/CSS but serves to primarily demonstrate my use of programming JavaScript emphasizing a command of syntax: conditionals, functions, scope, variables, data types and more. 

Experiment with a completed version of the project to get a sense of what I've built.

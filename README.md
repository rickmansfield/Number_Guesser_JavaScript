Overview

Project Goals
In this project, I've writem JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game. 

There are four functions in script.js. I’ve provided some additional JavaScript code in game.js that will call dependent functions based on user interactions, but you don’t need to look at game.js and shouldn’t edit it if you want your project to work as intended. As you complete this project, make sure that all of your functions are named exactly as specified so that they can be called correctly when the game is played.

These JavaScript functions are incorporated into a website that also uses HTML/CSS but serves to primarily demonstrate my use of programming JavaScript emphasizing a command of syntax: conditionals, functions, scope, variables, data types and more. 

Experiment with a completed version of the project to get a sense of what I've built.
